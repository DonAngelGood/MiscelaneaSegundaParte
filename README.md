# Miscellaneous Second Part

# File description

Within this second part, you can find all the exercises related to the subject of conditionals in python, these exercises are carried out within a single file called "main.py", managing a menu in which you can choose the number of exercise to execute, including these between 17 and 29.

# Exercises and Solution Model

17. Write the code necessary to know if a number is positive or negative.
     Initially, a number is requested by keyboard, then by means of a comparison between if it is greater or less than zero, the output is defined, that is, if it is positive or negative.
    
18. Write a Python program that reads two numbers from the keyboard and says which is larger and which is smaller.
     After requesting the two numbers by keyboard, a comparison is made between the two numbers entered, in order to know which is the largest and which is the smallest between themselves.

19. Write a program that reads three positive integers, and calculates and prints the smallest and largest of all.
     Within this exercise, after asking for the three numbers, they begin to compare themselves in different ways in order to define which is the largest and which is the smallest, taking into account that statistically, there are six possible combinations between three values to make their respective comparison.

20. Calculate the salary of the employees of a company. For this, the name of the employee, the normal hours worked and the overtime must be requested. Keep in mind that the value of the hour is $4 and that overtime is paid double.
     Having collected the employee's data, we will proceed to multiply the number of normal hours by 4, and the overtime hours by 8, storing the result in an accumulator variable in order to obtain the employee's salary.

21. Given two numbers A and B add them if A is less than B but subtract them.
     To begin with, the two numbers A and B are requested by typing, then, after comparing them with each other to find out which of the two rules is fulfilled, we proceed to perform the operation specified within the code block.

22. Given two numbers A and B, find the quotient between A and B. Remember that division by zero is not defined, in this case a legend should appear announcing that division is not possible.
     After requesting the divisor and dividend value from the keyboard, the dividend is compared with zero, if they are equal, the user is notified that said division is not allowed, in any contrary case, the division is made.

23. numDia is a numeric variable that can take 7 values, they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. Show the name of the day of the week that corresponds to the value of the variable numDia.
     Once the value for the variable has been entered, it is compared with the different numbers already mentioned, in order to reach the output, which is to print the name of the day depending on the corresponding number.

24. Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, determine if it is equilateral or not.
     Obtained by keyboard the three lengths, they are taken to the comparison, if the three values are equal, the user is notified that this is an equilateral triangle, otherwise it is not.

25. Given two numbers A and B add them if at least one of them is negative otherwise multiply them.
     Initially, the two numbers A and B are requested by keyboard, once inserted, they are compared in the same way as in exercise 17 to find out if it is possible to multiply or add them;

26. Asking for the day and month of birth to show the sign.
     Once the data has been obtained by keyboard, the different dates of the horoscope are compared with the two data that were provided, in order to identify the zodiac sign.

27. Asking for the entry of the base and the height of a quadrilateral, indicate if it is square or rectangle. For either case, show the perimeter and area of the figure.
     Initially, the two data requested by keyboard, are compared, if they are equal it is a square, otherwise it is a rectangle, once the comparison is finished, the area and perimeter are printed.

28. A business discounts the sales of its products. If the purchase is less than $100, the discount is 5%, if it is greater than or equal to 100 and less than 200, the discount is 10%, otherwise it will be 15%. Given the sale price, show the discount made in pesos and the final discounted price.
     First, the data required by keyboard is requested, once obtained, they are compared with the values provided by the exercise, in order to carry out the discount operation and print the result to the user.

29. Make an algorithm that determines if a year is a leap year or not.
     After obtaining the number of the year on the keyboard, the module between 4 is obtained, if this is equal to zero, the year is a leap year, otherwise it is not.
